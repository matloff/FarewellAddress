# Reflections on a Life in Computer Science and Statistics: Norm Matloff

On July 1, 2023, I will retire, after--incredibly--48 years on the
faculty of the University of California, Davis.

Just like George Washington :-) , I will give this "Farewell Address."
It certainly won't be historical like Washington's, and it's not really
a true farewell--I'll have an office, and intend to be active in
research and in writing books and software--but I hope some will find it
interesting, maybe surprising, and possibly useful.

I'll give an overview of my history, then present some thoughts--dare
I call them "recommendations"?--on
teaching and research on computer science and statistics.

# Formative Years

I was born in Los Angeles, and grew up in East LA and the San Gabriel
Valley.  

I've lived in immigrant households my entire life, complete with
non-English languages.  My father was an immigrant from Lithuania, and
my parents spoke Yiddish to each other (but spoke English to us kids).
My wife is an immigrant from Hong Kong, and Cantonese is the "official
language" in our family, including with our daughter.

I attended Cal Poly Pomona as a Math major and an Econ minor.  I lived
at home, with a 10-minute drive to school, and had a part-time job on
campus.  Cal Poly was not a "powerhouse" school, but one could get an
excellent education if one sought out the right faculty.  I had one
professor for several Math classes who gave very challenging proofs for
homework, and I took the bulk of my Econ classes from one particular
professor, whom I still quote to this day.

I took my first programming course as a freshman, 1966. So I've been programming 
for almost 60 years! I loved it from the start, and find it just as much fun today as I did back then.

After Cal Poly, I joined the PhD program in Math at UCLA, eventually doing a
dissertation in abstract probability theory with Tom Liggett.
I described both Tom and my days at UCLA
[here](https://tinyurl.com/ynyarcye).  I also was greatly influenced by
Prof. Tom Ferguson and Prof. Olive Jean Dunn; the latter is the
one who started me thinking about the [inappropriateness of significance
testing](https://github.com/matloff/qeML/blob/master/inst/mdFiles/No_P_Values.md).
I also talked a lot with Prof. Chuck Stone; he and I later became close friends when we moved to
adjoining towns in the Bay Area.

# Academic Career

*UC Davis!*

I had always wanted an academic career, with a very strong preference for California, and
was very pleased when the Math Dept. at UCD invited me for an interview
as I was finishing my PhD.  It was my first-ever plane ride!  Though I
did start to interview elsewhere, Davis quickly made me an offer, which
I accepted. I actually have been a member of four different departments during
my years here.

At that time, the Math Dept. had an informal statistics subgroup.  [We
and a couple of others](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/history) from
outside the department formed the Statistics Dept. in 1979.  (It was
actually called an "intercollegiate division" at that time.)

However, my attention was drawn elsewhere, as the first "computer
revolution" was in full swing, and as noted, I had always loved 
developing software. In addition, frankly, I was getting disillusioned
by academic politics.  Thus I took a year's leave of absence and worked
in Silicon Valley.

*Statistics and Computer Science*

While on leave, I was under pressure from the Stat Dept. to decide
whether to return.  I said yes, provided I could have a joint appointment 
with the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Dept.  (There was no Computer 
Science Dept. then, and by the way, no separate
Engineering salary scale.)  The ECE Chair was very supportive, and the
campus administration approved the request, and I resumed teaching in Fall 1980.

Later I participated in the establishment of the Division of Computer
Science within ECE, which eventually became the Computer Science Dept. in 1989.
Aganin, my strong desire was to have a joint appointment
between CS and Stat.  Unfortunately, I was told that the two collegiate
deans did not want to split a faculty slot, and I would have to choose
between one or the other.  I chose CS.

*My research*

I first published two theoretical papers based on my dissertation work, [one in the *Annals of Probability*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2242986) and [the other in the *Zeitschrift fur Wahscheinlichskeit*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2242986).

At the same time, I served as a statistical consultant for the Kaiser Permanente medical care system. That experience led directly to [my *Biometrika* paper on the asymptotics of averaged regression functions](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/68/3/685/218733?redirectedFrom=fulltext) and indeed has influenced much of my subsequent work, to this day.

Since my move to the CS Dept., I have done research that is purely CS, such as in parallel
computation.  However, much of my work has been in fields in which my
stat background has played a major role, such as data security and
machine learning.  

My work seems to have had some impact. For example, my data security research, such as
that published in [ACM TODS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/174638.174641),
led to my being appointed to IFIP WG 11.3, an international group devoted to fostering work 
in the field. My work on [polynomials in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06850)
attracted a lot of attention in discussion groups, and has led directly to published work by
others, such as [this paper in Neural Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608021001738?via%3Dihub).

I've always believed that teaching and research go hand-in-hand. My book, *Statistical Regression and Classification: 
from Linear Models to Machine Learning*, which was the recipient of the 2017 Ziegal Award, reflects that 
spirit. Though in the form of the textbook, it contain many "mini-research snippets," material that I believe is new
to the field.

Currently I am especially interested in the issue of Fairness in Machine
Learning, which combines my computing and stat interests with my
lifelong passion for social justice.  Two of my recent papers are
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06680) and
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06557).

*Involvement in controversial issues*

Whenever I've seen claims that "1 = 2," and about which I have some new points to add to the discussion,
I've spoken out. Sometimes this has been to my detriment, but as a scholar I feel the need to inform and clarify.

In the general sociopolitical realm, I've been active in my [support for Affirmative Action](https://www.significancemagazine.com/science/391-should-affirmative-action-be-replaced-with-random-selection)
in school admissions and hiring. But my most significant impact has been on the H-1B work visa, a program that everyone 
agrees is badly flawed but for which no good political solution has been agreed upon. My work on that issue
led to an invitation by a major law journal to write on the topic. The [paper](https://repository.law.umich.edu/mjlr/vol36/iss4/5/), 99 pages long with over 300 footnotes, has
had a major impact, I believe.

My work on these and other isssues has led to my being quoted or cited in all
major news outlets, print and electronic, and testimony to the US House and Senate.

My writings on more academic issues are known to a smaller audience, but are probably even more 
controversial. As mentioned above, one example is the [inappropriateness of significance
testing](https://github.com/matloff/qeML/blob/master/inst/mdFiles/No_P_Values.md). Another, very 
narrow but the subject of especially bitter debate in the field, is my view that the "Tidyverse" approach to
teaching the R programming language to noncoders, actually [makes things more difficult for that
group](https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic).

# Reflections

As always, I have a few thoughts...

Note first that my comments are meant to be general, not restricted to my own department or university. Of course, my local environment is the one with which I am the most familiar, but I believe I have had enough exposure to other departments/universities to be able to have reasonably informed views.

And of course, there are likely many exceptions to these general remarks.

## On Teaching

I've always been excited about teaching, and investigating how students
learn.  I've been fortunate to win a couple of teaching awards, 
notably the
[campus-wide Distinguished Teaching
Award](https://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk3876/files/local_resources/docs/committees/award_committees/2017-18/dta-call.pdf). To be sure, it must be said that student evaluations of teaching are sometimes
out of sync with broader, more nuanced assessment of quality, I am proud that several of my department
colleagues have also won that award over the years.

*Class size*

We are being asked to teach larger and larger classes. This is rationalized by having smaller discussion sections, but even they are getting larger. The quality of instruction suffers.

One of the many negative consequences of large class sizes is that examinations rely increasingly on rote memorization rather than measurement of true insight. The rote approach is easier to grade, but the message is sent to students that memorization is what counts, not insight.

*Begining programming curricula*

We are not serving our lower division programming students well. We are stressing syntax and semantics much more than what should be the focus, which is the building of strong programming muscles.

Thus I recommend Python as a first language, due to it's not being
strongly-typed.  Variable types are distractions from developing
algorithms.

Programming assignments in an introductory sequence should be
progressively more elaborate, with progressively less scaffolding.
The latter is key; I tell my students, "If you've never had the
experience of sitting down to write code and and thought, 'Hmm...how do
I even start?', then you've never had a chance to develop strong coding
skills."  Of course, hints should be doled out (sparingly) according to
individual student needs, but giving outlines in the assignment
statement should be avoided.

We also need to emphasize the importance of software development support infrastructure, so such as use of a debugging tool and knowledge of how search paths work.  It must be emphasized to students that they must not "erase their brains" of this material after the final exam, but instead should make active use of such material in their later courses.

*Computer systems issues*

People outside the field are amazed when I tell them that most CS students could not answer questions such as "How does a computer boot up?" and "What happens if we run a program with six threads on a four-core machine?" These are not "trade school" questions, but instead rely on fundamental concepts, such as OS being a program, the role of hardware interrupts and so on. I believe that OS and other systems courses should make sure to relate their content to the real world.

*Student admissions issues*

It's taken as an article of faith among progressives that one must oppose the use of standardized tests especially for school admissions.  If one doesn't toe tell that line, one is viewed as lacking sympathy for underrepresented minorities. The SAT is correlated with family income, they say, and that is supposed to end the discussion.

The SAT is far from perfect, but it does contain important information.  As to the wealth connection, that is easily solved by having admissions committees scale the SAT score relative to family income. 

I have long advocated a random lottery for school admissions, in which a threshold would be set based on test scores and grades, and admission being done randomly from the resulting pool. The threshold would be set at a level deemed necessary for doing good work at that institution.

## On Research

At least in Computer Science, we are in a crisis:

* The quality of reviewing, especially in conferences, is often atrocious. Reviewers have tunnel vision as to what kind of work is important, and often a reviewer simply does not have the expertise/insight to do a proper review.
    For example, in the case of paper I reviewed in 2023 for an ML conference, I felt the work was good but did not go far enough; I gave it a Weak Accept rating. The second reviewer merely said, "Not enough examples," and rated the work as Strong Reject, which in my view stemmed from the reviewer's not having the background needed to assess the work. Frankly, the reviewer's statement about examples was just an excuse, I believe.
    In my experience, that kind of incident occurs quite frequenty. Journal reviewing is somewhat better. I would recommend de-emphasizing conference work.
    
* There's often too much emphasis on quantity instead of quality.  The old joke that "Deans can't read but they can count" seems to apply more and more to faculty voting on advancements as well.
    There have been proposals that in review of faculty in advancement cases, the candidate submits his/her 5 (or whatever number) best papers for consideration. I believe such a policy is urgently needed.

* It appears to me, based both 
  in the case of my own department and some observations of others, there is less
  intradepartmental (as opposed to *inter*departmental) research
  collaboration in CS than, say, in Statistics. 
  
  In my case, I had hoped
  to be the "resident statistician" in CS, leading to a lot of
  collaboration with my CS colleagues.  This turned out not to be the
  case in recent years, and I see rather little joint work among other
  colleagues.  
  
  This may be related to the CS emphasis on funded
  research. Whatever the reason, it results in many
  missed opportunities.

## On the Dark Side of Academia

When I first began at Davis, a senior colleague advised me, "Form over substance, that's how the system works."
And nearly a century ago, when President Herbert Hoover was asked why he left Stanford to serve as President,'
he joked, "Because I wanted to get out of politics."

If anything, it's worse today. Actions are often taken that ostensibly improve teaching or research, while actually having no real impact, or even a negative one. And too many committees decide on the basis of personal or other extraneous conditions rather than what is good for the university students and faculty. Quite often there is an appalling lack of transparency.  

I served on the academic Senate Privilege and Tenure Committee, including two years as chair. 
I saw many cases of egregiously unfair treatment, sometimes vindictive, often heartbreaking. 
And there are many, many cases that, though less extreme in severity and not presented to the 
committee, have major adverse impacts on the victims. In some cases, such machinations by
faculty are done in collusion with department office staff.

It's unclear how to solve this problem in general, but improved transparency would be 
at the top of the list of remedies.

## On the future impact of Large Language Models

My view on this is mostly positive.

I believe they are currently less useful for teach matter than is generally thought.  ChatGPT is pretty good at writing code, but often lacking in being able to "see the big picture." See my
essay, (Like College Students, ChatGPT Finds Statistics Difficult)[https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2023/04/01/chatgpt-finds-statistics-difficult/]. Version 4 seems equally weak.



# Thanks

I've been blessed with a wonderful family, whose love, humor and wisdom
are inspiring and humbling.  I continue to believe that being an
academic is the best job in the world.  I've been extremely fortunate to
be in this line of work, and I thank everyone who has made it possible.
My heartfelt thanks to all!
