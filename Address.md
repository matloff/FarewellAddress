# Norm Matloff's Farewell Address

On July 1, 2023, I will retire, after--incredibly--48 years on the
faculty of the University of California, Davis.

Just like George Washington :-) , I will give this "Farewell Address."
It certainly won't be historical like Washington's, and it's not really
a true farewell--I'll have an office, and intend to be active in
research and in writing books and software--but I hope some will find it
interesting, maybe surprising, and possibly useful.

I'll give an overview of my history, then present some thoughts--dare
I call them "recommendations"?--on
teaching and research on computer science and statistics.

## Formative Years

I was born in Los Angeles, and grew up in East LA and the San Gabriel
Valley.  

I've lived in immigrant households my entire life, complete with
non-English languages.  My father was an immigrant from Lithuania, and
my parents spoke Yiddish to each other (but spoke English to us kids).
My wife is an immigrant from Hong Kong, and Cantonese is the "official
language" in our house, including with our daughter.

I attended Cal Poly Pomona as a Math major and an Econ minor.  I lived
at home, with a 10-minute drive to school, and had a part-time job on
campus.  Cal Poly was not a "powerhouse" school, but one could get an
excellent education if one sought out the right faculty.  I had one
professor for several Math classes who gave very challenging proofs for
homework, and I took the bulk of my Econ classes from one particular
professor, whom I still quote to this day.

I then joined the PhD program in Math at UCLA, eventually doing a
dissertation in abstract probability theory with the late Tom Liggett.
I described both Tom and my days at UCLA
[here](https://tinyurl.com/ynyarcye).  I also was greatly influenced by
Prof. Tom Ferguson and the late Prof. Olive Jean Dunn; the latter is the
one who started me thinking about the [inappropriateness of significance
testing](https://github.com/matloff/qeML/blob/master/inst/mdFiles/No_P_Values.md).
I also talked a lot with the late Prof. Chuck Stone; he and I later became close friends when we moved to
adjoining towns in the Bay Area.

## Academic career

*UC Davis!*

I had always wanted an academic career, with a very strong preference for California, and
was very pleased when the Math Dept. at UCD invited me for an interview
as I was finishing my PhD.  It was my first-ever plane ride!  Though I
did start to interview elsewhere, Davis quickly made me an offer, which
I accepted. I actually have been a member of four different departments during
my years here.

At that time, the Math Dept. had an informal statistics subgroup.  [We
and a couple of others](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/history) from
outside the department formed the Statistics Dept. in 1979.  (It was
actually called an "intercollegiate division" at that time.)

However, my attention was drawn elsewhere, as the first "computer
revolution" was in full swing, and frankly, I was getting disillusioned
by academic politics.  Thus I took a year's leave of absence and worked
in Silicon Valley.

*Statistics and Computer Science*

While on leave, I was under pressure from the Stat Dept. to decide
whether to return.  I said yes, provided I could have a joint appointment 
with the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Dept.  (There was no Computer 
Science Dept. then, and by the way, no separate
Engineering salary scale.)  The ECE Chair was very supportive, and the
campus administration approved the request, and I resumed teaching in Fall 1980.

Later I participated in the establishment of the Division of Computer
Science within ECE, which eventually became the Computer Science Dept. in 1989.
Aganin, my strong desire was to have a joint appointment
between CS and Stat.  Unfortunately, I was told that the two collegiate
deans did not want to split a faculty slot, and I would have to choose
between one or the other.  I chose CS.

*My research*

Since then, I have done research that is purely CS, such as in parallel
computation.  However, much of my work has been in fields in which my
stat background has played a major role, such as data security and
machine learning.  

My work seems to have had some impact. For example, my data security research, such as
that published in [ACM TODS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/174638.174641),
led to my being appointed to IFIP WG 11.3, an international group devoted to fostering work 
in the field. My work on [polynomials in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06850)
attracted a lot of attention in discussion groups, and has led directly to published work by
others, such as [this paper in Neural Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608021001738?via%3Dihub).

I've always believed that teaching and research go hand-in-hand. My book, *Statistical Regression and Classification: 
from Linear Models to Machine Learning*, which was the recipient of the 2017 Ziegal Award, reflects that 
spirit. Though in the form of the textbook, it contain many "mini-research snippets," material that I believe is new
to the field.

Currently I am especially interested in the issue of Fairness in Machine
Learning, which combines my computing and stat interests with my
lifelong passion for social justice.  Two of my recent papers are
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06680) and
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06557).

*Involvement in controversial issues*

Whenever I've seen claims that "1 = 2," and about which I have some new points to add to the discussion,
I've spoken out. Sometimes this has been to my detriment, but as a scholar I feel the need to inform and clarify.

In the general sociopolitical realm, I've been active in my [support for Affirmative Action](https://www.significancemagazine.com/science/391-should-affirmative-action-be-replaced-with-random-selection)
in school admissions and hiring. But my most significant impact has been on the H-1B work visa, a program that everyone 
agrees is badly flawed but for which no good political solution has been agreed upon. My work on that issue
led to an invitation by a major law journal to write on the topic. The [paper](https://repository.law.umich.edu/mjlr/vol36/iss4/5/), 99 pages long with over 300 footnotes, has
had a major impact, I believe.

My work on these and other isssues has led to my being quoted or cited in all
major news outlets, print and electronic, and testimony to the US House and Senate.

My writings on more academic issues are known to a smaller audience, but are probably even more 
controversial. As mentioned above, one example is the [inappropriateness of significance
testing](https://github.com/matloff/qeML/blob/master/inst/mdFiles/No_P_Values.md). Another, very 
narrow but the subject of especially bitter debate in the field, is my view that the "Tidyverse" approach to
teaching the R programming language to noncoders, actually [makes things more difficult for that
group](https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic).

## Thoughts on academic computer science and the profession in general

*Thoughts on teaching*

I've always been excited about teaching, and investigating how students
learn.  I've been fortunate to win a couple of teaching awards, 
notably the
[campus-wide Distinguished Teaching
Award](https://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk3876/files/local_resources/docs/committees/award_committees/2017-18/dta-call.pdf).
