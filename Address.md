# Norm Matloff's Farewell Address

On July 1, 2023, I will retire, after--incredibly--48 years on the
faculty of the University of California, Davis.

Just like George Washington :-) , I will give this "Farewell Address."
It certainly won't be historical like Washington's, and it's not really
a true farewell--I'll have an office, and intend to be active in
research and in writing books and software--but I hope some will find it
interesting, maybe surprising, and possibly useful.

I'll start with a brief overview of my history, then address issues in
teaching and research in computer science and statistics.

## Formative Years

I was born in Los Angeles, and grew up in East LA and the San Gabriel
Valley.  

I've lived in immigrant households my entire life, complete with
non-English languages.  My father was an immigrant from Lithuania, and
my parents spoke Yiddish to each other (but spoke English to us kids).
My wife is an immigrant from Hong Kong, and Cantonese is the "official
language" in our house, including with our daughter.

I attended Cal Poly Pomona as a Math major and an Econ minor.  I lived
at home, with a 10-minute drive to school, and had a part-time job on
campus.  Cal Poly was not a "powerhouse" school, but one could get an
excellent education if one sought out the right faculty.  I had one
professor for several Math classes who gave very challenging proofs for
homework, and I took the bulk of my Econ classes from one particular
professor, whom I still quote to this day.

I then joined the PhD program in Math at UCLA, eventually doing a
dissertation in abstract probability theory with the late Tom Liggett.
I described both Tom and my days at UCLA
[here](https://tinyurl.com/ynyarcye).  I also was greatly influenced by
Prof. Tom Ferguson and the late Prof. Olive Jean Dunn; the latter is the
one who started me thinking about the [inappropriateness of significance
testing](https://github.com/matloff/qeML/blob/master/inst/mdFiles/No_P_Values.md).
I also talked a lot with the late Prof. Chuck Stone; though he was 12
years my senior, he and I later became close friends when we moved to
adjoining towns in the Bay Area.

## Academic career

*UC Davis!*

I had always wanted an academic career, with a very strong preference for California, and
was very pleased when the Math Dept. at UCD invited me for an interview
as I was finishing my PhD.  It was my first-ever plane ride!  Though I
did start to interview elsewhere, Davis quickly made me an offer, which
I accepted. I actually have been a member of four different departments during
my years here.

At that time, the Math Dept. had an informal statistics subgroup.  [We
and a couple of others](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/history) from
outside the department, formed the Statistics Dept. in 1979.  (It was
actually called an "intercollegiate division" at that time.)

However, my attention was drawn elsewhere, as the first "computer
revolution" was in full swing, and frankly, I was getting disillusioned
by academic politics.  Thus I took a year's leave of absence and worked
in Silicon Valley.

*Statistics and Computer Science

While on leave, I was under pressure from the Stat Dept. to decide
whether to return.  I said yes, provided I could have a joint appointment 
with the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Dept.  (There was no Computer 
Science Dept. then, and by the way, no separate
Engineering salary scale.)  The ECE Chair was very supportive, and the
campus administration approved the request, and I resumed teaching in Fall 1980.

Later I participated in the establishment of the Division of Computer
Science within ECE, which eventually became the Computer Science Dept. in 1989.
Aganin, my strong desire was to have a joint appointment
between CS and Stat.  Unfortunately, I was told that the two collegiate
deans did not want to split a faculty slot, and I would have to choose
between one or the other.  I chose CS.

*My research*

Since then, I have done research that is purely CS, such as in parallel
computation.  However, much of my work has been in fields in which my
stat background has played a major role, such as data security and
machine learning.  

My work seems to have had some impact. For example, my data security research, such as
that published in [ACM TODS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/174638.174641),
led to my being appointed to IFIP WG 11.3, an international group devoted to fostering work 
in the field. My work on [polynomials in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06850)
attracted a lot of attention in discussion groups, and has led directly to published work by
others, such as [this paper in Neural Networks])https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608021001738?via%3Dihub).

Currently I am especially interested in the issue of Fairness in Machine
Learning, which combines my computing and stat interests with my
lifelong passion for social justice.  Two of my recent papers are
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06680) and
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06557).

## Issues in teaching 

I've always been excited about teaching, and investigating how students
learn.  I've been fortunate to win a couple of teaching awards, 
notably the
[campus-wide Distinguished Teaching
Award](https://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk3876/files/local_resources/docs/committees/award_committees/2017-18/dta-call.pdf

I've always believed that teaching and research go hand-in-hand.  I
believe that book, *Statistical Regession and Classification: from
Linear Models to Machne Learning*, winner of the Ziegel Award of 2017,
epitomizes that spirit.
